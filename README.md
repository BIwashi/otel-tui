# otel-tui

A terminal OpenTelemetry viewer inspired by [otel-desktop-viewer](https://github.com/CtrlSpice/otel-desktop-viewer/tree/main).

This tool currently supports OpenTelemetry, Zipkin (Traces) and Prometheus (Metrics) formats.

## Getting Started
Currently, this tool exposes the ports:
- `4317` to receive OpenTelemetry signals (gRPC)
- `4318` to receive OpenTelemetry signals (HTTP)
- `9411` to receive Zipkin traces (enabled by `--enable-zipkin` option)

Options:

```
Usage:
  otel-tui [flags]

Flags:
      --enable-prom               Enable the prometheus receiver
      --enable-zipkin             Enable the zipkin receiver
      --grpc int                  The port number on which we listen for OTLP grpc payloads (default 4317)
  -h, --help                      help for otel-tui
      --host string               The host where we expose our OTLP endpoints (default "0.0.0.0")
      --http int                  The port number on which we listen for OTLP http payloads (default 4318)
      --prom-target stringArray   The target endpoints for the prometheus receiver (--prom-target "localhost:9000" --prom-target "other-host:9000")
  -v, --version                   version for otel-tui
```

### Homebrew

```sh
$ brew install ymtdzzz/tap/otel-tui
```

### go install

```sh
$ go install github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui@latest
```

### Docker

Run in the container simply:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it --name otel-tui ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest
```

Or, run as a background process and attach it:

```sh
# Run otel-tui as a background process
$ docker run --rm -dit --name otel-tui ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest

# Show TUI in your current terminal session
$ docker attach otel-tui

# Detach by pressing Ctrl+p -> Ctrl+q
```

### Docker Compose

First, add service to your manifest (`docker-compose.yaml`) for the instrumanted app

```yml
  oteltui:
    image: ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest
    container_name: otel-tui
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    # Override entrypoint if you want use options
    entrypoint: ["/otel-tui", "--enable-zipkin"]
```

Modify configuration for otelcol

```yml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: oteltui:4317
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Run as a background process and attach it:

```sh
# Run services as usual
$ docker compose up -d

# Show TUI in your current terminal session
$ docker compose attach oteltui

# Detach by pressing Ctrl+p -> Ctrl+q
```
